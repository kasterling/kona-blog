üå¥ A Week in Kona: Coffee, Lava, and a Slight Sunburn

I landed in Kona with two goals: soak up the island vibes and convince myself that ‚Äúwork-life balance‚Äù should lean heavily toward ‚Äúlife.‚Äù The Big Island greeted me with warm trade winds, the scent of plumeria, and an airport that felt more like a tropical bus stop than a transportation hub.

My first stop? Kona Brewing Co. Because when in Hawaii, the right way to say ‚ÄúAloha‚Äù is apparently with a Longboard Lager in hand. Lunch was fresh mahi mahi tacos, eaten slowly while pretending I might take up surfing after. (Spoiler: I didn‚Äôt.)

The rest of the week was a blur of black sand, turquoise water, and roadside fruit stands where mangoes were so ripe they practically introduced themselves. I explored Magic Sands Beach‚Äîwhich, true to its name, managed to both enchant me and try to knock me over with a wave at the same time. Kua Bay was next, a postcard come to life with white sand so bright I briefly considered sunglasses as indoor wear.

One morning I drove south to Pu ªuhonua o H≈çnaunau National Historical Park, a place so peaceful I half-expected the ancient Hawaiians to tap me on the shoulder and ask if I wanted to stay forever. Later that day, I found myself at a coffee farm tour up in Holualoa, sipping 100% Kona coffee so smooth I briefly forgave my alarm clock for existing.

In the evenings, I wandered Ali ªi Drive‚Äîbrowsing art galleries, watching the sunset ignite the ocean in gold and orange, and sampling poke bowls with the dedication of a scientist gathering data.

By the end of the week, I had a slightly uneven tan, a phone full of ocean photos, and a mental list of reasons to come back. Kona has a way of making you feel like you‚Äôve been away for months while also wishing you could stay for years.

As I boarded the plane home, I realized the real souvenir wasn‚Äôt the bag of coffee beans in my backpack‚Äîit was the lingering sense that maybe, just maybe, I belonged somewhere the ocean could see me every morning.
