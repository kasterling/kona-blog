Hey fam, just wanted to catch you up on what's going on here in Kona. Today we went snorkeling with the sea turtles, and it was nothing short of awesome! The Honu are absolutely amazing creatures course, but my gosh, what an incredible experience being in the water with these gentle giants. You've got to do this if you ever make it out here - it's truly unforgettable.
